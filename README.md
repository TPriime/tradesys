## Gaming Trading System

The system should simulate a gamified trading feature for an investment app and allow users to:
1. Create portfolios and add assets.
2. Simulate trading of assets (buy/sell).
3. Earn gems based on trading activities.
4. Introduce a ranking system that tracks users with the highest gem count.

### Rewards System

#### Base Rewards
- 1 gem per trade (buy or sell)

#### Milestone Bonuses
- 5 bonus gems at 5 trades
- 10 bonus gems at 10 trades
- Bonus gems of trade count at every 20 trades thereafter (20, 40, etc.)

#### Streak Bonuses
- 3 gems for every consecutive 3 trades, reset if trade is performed by another user
- Bonus gems equal to streak count when streak â‰¥ 7
